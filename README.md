   I’m interested in data integration / engineering with Azure Data factory and SSIS. I created Data Integration Lifecycle Management Suite to support enterprise DevOps with SSIS. Most DILMSuite utilities are free and many are open source (stored here)! Learn more by visiting [DILM Suite](https://dilmsuite.com).
   
   When I’m not creating DILM software, I deliver [consulting](https://entdna.com) and [training](https://entdna.com/training) for [Enterprise Data & Analytics](https://entdna.com).

   I’m constantly learning!

   You may reach me at [Contact DILM Suite](https://dilmsuite.com/contact-us/) or [Contact Enterprise Data & Analytics](https://entdna.com/contact/).
